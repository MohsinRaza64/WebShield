This desktop application enhances online safety through two main components: a proxy server and a malware file detector. The proxy server monitors users' browsing activity and automatically blocks access to malicious or blacklisted websites. The malware file detector deletes files known to be malicious based on threat intelligence from open-source sources as soon as they are downloaded.

Additionally, the application features manual website blocking, allowing users to block suspicious websites and add exceptions for sites that would otherwise be falsely blocked according to MISP threat intelligence. The user-friendly interface provides real-time logs of activities, including blocked malicious websites, deleted malicious files, and download history.

Future plans for this application include the addition of advanced features such as machine learning-based malware detection and sandboxing techniques.
